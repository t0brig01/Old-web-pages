		<h1>Getting Started</h1>
		<h2>Controls</h2>
		<h3>Fight Stick</h3>
		<p>If you are using a fight stick such as the one shown in the picture, there is a control stick and either 6 or 8 buttons. The one I am showing you have 8 buttons. The top row of buttons are your punch attacks. The bottom row are you're kick attacks. The strength of the attack is based on which button you hit. From left to right, the buttons are light, medium, heavy, and all 3. While I do recommend you get a fight stick, it is not required to play. You can also play with just a controller. </p>

		<h3>Controller</h3>
		<p>When using a controller, you will use the control stick, the 4 buttons, both bumpers, and both triggers. Using default controls, A is light kick, B is medium kick, LB is heavy kick, RB is all three kick, X is light punch, Y is medium punch, LT is heavy punch, and RT is all three punch.</p>

		<h3>More Control Stick Info</h3>
		<p>One thing that makes Street Fighter a unique game is that it has more input options than up, down, left, right, and neutral. This allows for more moves. An example of this is that you can input quarter circles and half circles. For example, the input for a hadouken or a fireball (as seen on the home page) is quarter circle forward and an attack. </p>
