		<h1>Advanced</h1>
		<p>Once you learn basic combos with your character, you can learn more advanced combos. You can learn how to do advanced things such as FADC (Focus attack dash cancel).</p>
		<h2>FADC</h2>
		<p>This is used to either cancel moves or to utilize the focus attack's super armor to take a hit without losing health. This is an example of an FADC combo.</p>
		<p>cr.lp/cr.mp > cl.hp xx Hadouken xx FADC > cr.hp xx MK Ryusokyaku > cr.lp/cr.mp xx LK Tatsu > HP Shoryuken</p>
		<p>The slashes mean you can do either move. cr.lp/cr.mp means you can either use crouching light punch or crouching medium punch. Most of the time it is based on preference and which move you think is best.	</p>
