		<h1>Basics</h1>
		<p>After you get used to all the controls, you should learn your characters special moves and how to perform them. Once you have that down, you can learn combos. When looking up combos, it will most likely be in combo notation or abbreviations. Here's a list of abbreviaitons.</p>
		<h2>Motion Abbreviations</h2>

<p>Despite the increasing variety among fighting games, certain fundamental input strings continue to appear in the majority of movelists. Many common acronyms for such strings are catalogued below. Most special move commands consist of one or more of the following motions combined with an appropriately timed button input, typically following the completion of the motion.</p>

<p>QCF - quarter circle forward (D, DF, F)</p>

<p>QCB - quarter circle back (D, DB, B)</p>

<p>HCF - half circle forward (B, DB, D, DF, F)</p>

<p>HCB - half circle back (F, DF, D, DB, B)</p>

<p>DP - dragon punch motion (F, D, DF)</p>

<p>RDP - reverse dragon punch motion (B, D, DB)</p>

<p>360 - full circle motion (for example F, D, B, U, F)</p>

<p>720 - double full circle motion (for example F, D, B, U, F, D, B, U, F)</p>

<p>AD - air dash (in air, PP); commonly followed by specified direction (ADDF = air dash DF)</p>

<p>LP - Light punch</p>

<p>MP - Medium punch</p>

<p>HP - Heavy punch</p>

<p>LK - Light Kick</p>

<p>MK - Medium Kick</p>

<p>HK - Heavy Kick</p>

<p>PP or 2P - press two punches simultaneously (for example LP + MP)</p>

<p>PPP or 3P - press all three punches simultaneously (LP + MP + HP)</p>

<p>KK or 2K - press two kicks simultaneously (for example MK + HK)</p>

<p>KKK or 3K - press all three kicks simultaneously (LK + MK + HK)</p>

<p>charge - hold specified input for two seconds before proceeding to next command</p>

<h2>Common Symbols</h2>

<p>Although relatively few in number, symbols are crucial to the accurate traversal of command notation. Created by the Street Fighter community to represent the many transitions between movements and attacks, they are the true verbs of the language.</p>

<p>s - standing; always followed by specified attack (s.LP = standing LP)</p>

<p>c - crouching; always followed by specified attack (c.MP = crouching MP)</p>

<p>j - jumping; always followed by specified attack (j.HP = jumping HP)</p>

<p>sj - superjumping; always followed by specified attack (sj.LK = superjumping LK)</p>

<p>+ - simultaneously with; always placed between two actions (F+MK = press forward and MK)</p>

<p>xx - cancel; always placed between two actions (c.MK xx QCF+P = cancel c.MK into QCF+P)</p>

<p>-> - chain; always placed between two actions (s.LP -> s.MP = chain s.LP into s.MP)</p>

<p>/\ - jump; clarifies transition from ground to air actions (c.HP /\ j.LP = jump-cancel c.HP into j.LP)</p>

<p>\/ - land; clarifies transition from air to ground actions (j.HP \/ s.LP = follow j.HP with s.LP)</p>
<br>
<h3>Some notation is a little different from this but barely. I know this seems like a lot, but don't worry. It's not hard once you learn the basics.</h3>
<br>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>cr.lk > cr.lp > cr.lp > cr.mp xx Hadouken</p>
<p>This is a Ryu combo. The notation explains that you perform a crouching light kick to crouching light punch to crouching light punch to crouching medium punch cancelled into a Hadouken, which is quarter circle forward and an attack.</p>

<h2>Super Meter</h2>
<p>Below are the actions that drain Super Meter, including their cost:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Performing an EX Special Move (1 Block)</li>
	<li>Canceling a Normal Attack into a Focus Attack (2 Blocks)</li>
	<li>Canceling a Special Attack into a Focus Attack (2 Blocks)</li>
	<li>Performing a Super Combo (4 Blocks)</li>
</ul>
